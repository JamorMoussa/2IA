# 2IA GitHub Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my notes and learning resources for delving into the realm of machine learning.

## Structure:

### machine-learning:
I aim to delve into machine learning algorithms, exploring not only their practical usage but also delving into the underlying mathematical concepts. The journey will involve understanding how to implement these algorithms using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and, additionally, constructing them from scratch using Python.

Ultimately, my goal is to consolidate all the algorithms I create into a custom machine learning library, providing a cohesive and personalized toolkit for future projects.
